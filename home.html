                <p>Every lunchtime, a mound of plastic wrappers is born. To combat this, we have the Environment Club. Here, we plant native plants, clean up litter, and take care of our local ecosystem, because at Environment Club, we strive to make Burnside a cleaner, healthier space.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <p>We do our best to help our local environment, and one way we do this is by cleaning up litter. At Burnside High, we promote using rubbish bins, however, still many students prefer the convienience of using the open ground instead. Students come to school every day buying pies and sausage rolls, with each item leaving a wrapper behind after school. Because of this, after every term we tactically split up around the school in groups - picking up every single wrapper, pen, bottle, and sticker we can find. We usually fill at least one whole landfill bin from this, which shows the impact of our cleaning.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <p>A central part of the Environment Club is planting native New Zealand plants. With all of the deforestations and pests that have damaged our local ecosystem, we help to build back our native life by planting native flora. We plant and look after many different species of plants ranging from Kauri trees to native ferns. If you feel the need to help our environment, then please, come over and check out the Environment Club!</p>
